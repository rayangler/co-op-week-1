My favorite editor is ﻿﻿﻿﻿Atom. I like it because it is a lightweight text editor
with minimal buttons for distraction and compatibility across Windows, Mac, and
Linux. It allows me to keep track of my git branch and diffs
in my repos thanks to its synchronization with Github. I also like how
it is compatible with many different programming languages and is capable of
downloading packages and tools to improve the way Atom works to my needs.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿
